1.L&D_combined_years.R: Initial file processing of the raw metabolite files from the raw folder, including: 
	outlier removal using MAD, and plot-level averages for the 2018 and 2019 mature kernel metabolites (analyzed separately),
	results generated from the script were also numbered 1

2.LD_SAScode_USED.txt: SAS codes to conduct statistical tests for the mature kernel metabolites, 2018 and 2019 analyzed in parallel:
	1)Levene's tests 
	2)Studentized residuals
	3)ANOVA
	4)Tukey's tests
	5)BLUE calculation
	All results (except studentized residuals) were pasted into 2.L&D_stat_tests_20200917.xlsx
2.1.studentized_resid_SAS_2018 & 2.1.studentized_resid_SAS_2019: folders containing studentized residuals and plots (all generated by SAS codes) and the R code for consolidating SAS results

3.plot_barplot_with_tukey.R: plot bar plots of untransformed BLUEs from 2018 and 2019 results, with Turkey's result labelled.
